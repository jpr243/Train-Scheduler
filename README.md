# Train-Scheduler

Overview
The objective was to create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. 

The app retrieves and manipulates the data with Moment.js. The website provides up-to-date information about various trains - arrival times  and minutes remaining until the next train.
